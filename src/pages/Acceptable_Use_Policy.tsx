          <h1>Interactive Services</h1>
          <br />
          We may from time to time provide interactive services on our site,
          such as the ability to participate in games, competitions, comment on
          blog posts, or post to our social media accounts (interactive
          services).
          <br />
          <br />
          Where we do provide any interactive service, we will provide clear
          information to you about the kind of service offered, if it is
          moderated and what form of moderation is used (including whether it is
          human or technical).
          <br />
          <br />
          We will do our best to assess any possible risks for users (and in
          particular, for children) from third parties when they use any
          interactive service provided on our site, and we will decide in each
          case whether it is appropriate to use moderation of the relevant
          service (including what kind of moderation to use) in the light of
          those risks. However, we are under no obligation to oversee, monitor
          or moderate any interactive service we provide on our site, and we
          expressly exclude our liability for any loss or damage arising from
          the use of any interactive service by a user in contravention of our
          content standards, whether the service is moderated or not.
          <br />
          <br />
          The use of any of our interactive services by a minor is subject to
          the consent of their parent or guardian. We advise parents who permit
          their children to use an interactive service that it is important that
          they communicate with their children about their safety online, as
          moderation is not foolproof. Minors who are using any interactive
          service should be made aware of the potential risks to them.
          <br />
          <br />
          Where we do moderate an interactive service, we will normally provide
          you with a means of contacting the moderator, should a concern or
          difficulty arise.
          <br />
          <br />
