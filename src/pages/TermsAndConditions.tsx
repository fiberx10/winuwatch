          <br /> Any failure by either party to exercise or enforce any right or
          provision of this agreement does not constitute a &apos;waiver&apos;
          (i.e., that it cannot be enforced later). If any part of this

          insofar as expressly stated otherwise.

          disputes will be decided only by the courts of the United Kingdom. If
